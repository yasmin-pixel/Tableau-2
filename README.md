- Built KPIs to show top spenders, average spend per customer, and customer lifetime value proxies.

### ðŸ“‹ Dashboard Creation
- Developed an interactive dashboard that enables filtering by customer segment, product type, and time period.

**Main Tool Used**: Tableau  
**Supporting Tools**: Excel (for data prep)

## Key Findings & Insights

Analysis of the 2020â€“2024 customer data revealed the following key insights:

- **Top Spending Segments**: A small percentage of customers accounted for a large portion of revenue.
- **High Value Customers**: Repeat customers spent significantly more on average than new or occasional buyers.
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Customer engagement and spend peaked around holidays and winter months.
- **Product Preferences**: Certain customer segments consistently preferred specific product categories.

## Limitations & Future Work

- **No Demographic Data**: Lacking age, location, or gender limits deeper persona-building.
- **Limited Historical Context**: Data is limited to 2020â€“2024; including pre-2020 trends could offer deeper comparisons.
- **Churn Prediction**: Adding predictive modeling for churn and lifetime value (using Python or R) would enhance the analysis.

Future work could also include integration with CRM data, loyalty program tracking, or web traffic for a more holistic view of customer behavior.
